# ImageUploader
A simple file uploader written in Python using Flask


## Notice
ImageUploader is currently in the process of being fully rewritten to be more efficient and generally easier to use/better. Importing information from an existing ImageUploader V1 installation should be a feature and should be fairly easy to perform. I will provide updates as needed.

For documentation, please see the Wiki.
If you require support, please create an issue.
